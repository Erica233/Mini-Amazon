# ERSS-project-fm128-zg79



## Getting started

To start this Amazon server, you need to specify the hostname of the world simulator, assigning it to the variable 'worldHost' 

in /backend/app/src/main/java/edu/duke/ece568/amazon/WorldOperator.java.

Besides, you also need a UPS server for package pick-up delivering, and these two servers together compose a complete system.

For the connection between the frontend website and the backend server, you need to determine the local hostname in views.py

in Django, which on my laptop is "172.22.0.1".

Wish you have a pleasant shopping experience!
