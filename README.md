## Getting started

To start this Amazon server, you need to specify the hostname of the world simulator, assigning it to the variable 'worldHost' 

in /backend/app/src/main/java/edu/duke/ece568/amazon/WorldOperator.java.

Besides, you also need a UPS server for package pick-up delivering, and these two servers together compose a complete system.

Wish you have a pleasant shopping experience!
