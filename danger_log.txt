Danger log

4.6
We met with our IG members and discussed the prototype of our Amazon-UPS protocol together.
We designed several message types that would be applied in the communication between Amazon
and UPS. Besides, we also used lucid chart to drew the functionality diagram to help us understand
the communication logic among Amazon, UPS and the world simulator.

4.7
We discussed the fundamental design of our project and finally decided to use Django for the website 
design and Java for the backend server. We also imported the draft protocol and converted it to Java
file, which contains interface of various message types that could be utilized for communication.

4.8
We mainly focused on the backend design. We applied Java socket package to try to get connection with
the world simulator. The operation on inputtream and outputstream is tricky, and we referred to the google 
protocol buffer documentation and found appropriate functions to send and receive messages through sockets
via coded stream, like writeUInt32NoTag() for sending and readRawVarint32() for receiving. Finally we 
successfully sent a message to the world simulator and received the "connected" response.

4.9
We met with our IG members again to modify our Amazon-UPS protocol under the guidance from the TA. We mainly 
focused on the package details to include during communication and clarified the usage of acks. However, we 
kept the problem of truck regulation to the next meeting. Besides, we built the structure of Django for our 
frontend and successfully got connection with the website.

4.10
We discussed together about the models we need to build in this project. As a prototype, we basically came up with
tables for users, products, items and packages and created them in our database. At the backend side, we learnd JDBC
from the official postgres tutorial and successfully got connection with the database and could query and modify data 
in it.

4.11
Based on the Amazon-UPS protocol, we tried to write the socket connection between Amazon and UPS, which is quite similar
with that for world simulator. Based on our design, we made some modifications to cover correct informaiton in messages that
would be sent from the UPS side and hand over to the world simulator after parse. Since we did not have the help from a UPS 
team, we just kept our code without testing and moved on.
