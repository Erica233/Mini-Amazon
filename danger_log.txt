Danger log

4.6
We met with our IG members and discussed the prototype of our Amazon-UPS protocol together.We designed 
several message types that would be applied in the communication between Amazon and UPS. Besides, we also 
used lucid chart to drew the functionality diagram to help us understand the communication logic among 
Amazon, UPS and the world simulator.

4.7
We discussed the fundamental design of our project and finally decided to use Django for the website 
design and Java for the backend server. We also imported the draft protocol and converted it to Java
file, which contains interface of various message types that could be utilized for communication.

4.8
We mainly focused on the backend design. We applied Java socket package to try to get connection with
the world simulator. The operation on inputtream and outputstream is tricky, and we referred to the google 
protocol buffer documentation and found appropriate functions to send and receive messages through sockets
via coded stream, like writeUInt32NoTag() for sending and readRawVarint32() for receiving. Finally we 
successfully came up two two general functions, one for message sending and one for receiving, and sent a 
message to the world simulator and received the "connected" response.

4.9
We met with our IG members again to modify our Amazon-UPS protocol under the guidance from the TA. We 
mainly focused on the package details to include during communication and clarified the usage of acks.
However, we kept the problem of truck regulation to the next meeting. Besides, we built the structure of 
Django for our frontend and successfully got connection with the website.

4.10
We discussed together about the models we need to build in this project. As a prototype, we basically came 
up with tables for users, products, items and packages and created them in our database. At the backend side, 
we learnd JDBC from the official postgres tutorial and successfully got connection with the database and 
could query and modify data in it.

4.11
Based on the Amazon-UPS protocol, we tried to write the socket connection between Amazon and UPS, which is 
quite similar with that for world simulator. Based on our design, we made some modifications to cover correct 
informaiton in messages that would be sent from the UPS side and hand over to the world simulator after parse. 
Since we did not have the help from a UPS team, we just kept our code without testing and moved on.

4.12
We re-designed the fundamental structure of our backend server. Basically, we divided our Amazon server into 
three separate operators, handling messages from world simulator, UPS server and frontend website respectively.
Besides, we gathered all the query and update functions related with database into an individual class, so that
each operator could easily use it to get in touch with PostgreSQL.

4.13
We met with those two UPS teams and tested our connection between Amazon server and UPS server, and the result
was correct. Besides, we also disscussed together about the message for package pick-up and truck assignment.
As a result, we decided to let UPS side assign packages to a specific truck and let Amazon side decide when
to send a truck for delivery. After discussion, we upgraded our protocol and slightly modified some functions
in our Amazon server.

4.14
We designed a basic frontend website that could purchase one product and inform the backend when the order
is saved into the database. For our Amazon server, we made it available to purchase product from world
simulator and pack the package afterwards. Meanwhile, we implemented the request for pick-up in UPS operator 
and also added relation sql functions with packages. 

4.15
We finished the remaining part of communication with world simulator and UPS server, including package packing, 
package loading, request for truck delivery and receive notifications when a package is delivered to the destination.
Meanwhile, we implemented relevant database-related functions, which could query necessary data and update the change
of package status at the right time.

4.16
Since we had basically accomplished the entire message transfer process, we tried to use acks to ensure the reliability 
of our communication with the world similar and UPS server. If we do not keep track of the acks we sent and received 
and implement no function to deal with them, then the world simulator, as well as the UPS server, would not get feedback 
that the message was successfully received by our Amazon server. Similary, our Amazon server would not never be informed 
when the otherside received our message. As a result, both sides would repeatly sending the same message, which would 
significantly slow down the process speed our the whole communication system.

4.17
We added multi-thread features into our Amazon server. Basically, we have three threads, dealing with messages from 
the world simulator, the UPS server and the frontend website respectively. In each thread, when handing messages, 
we would spread out more threads to process different responses. For acks handler, we chose ScheduledExecutorService
and ScheduledFuture to keep sending a same message every 5 seconds and would get shut down when we receive the
corresponding acks from the response.

4.18 - 4.19
We had finishend our backend server and started to improve our frontend website to be more acutally useful. We first
implemented the user login system, which could enable our cuntomer to sign up for an account and then login into our 
website for shopping. As a mini-Amazon, We created four major categories and added three products for each type. 
Temporarily without shopping cart, customer could only purchase one kind of product at a time with their specified 
amount, then fill out the destination and optional UPS account at the checkout stage. From main page, the user could 
view all his order history and check the details of products and package status there. 

4.20-4.21
We tried to add some extra features to our frontend website. We designed one html to show the specific information of 
one product. All products would be rendered to the same html, and we used a sting connected behind the url to identify 
the name of product. We added a search bar for customer to do a quick search and locate their ideal product. If the 
customer entered an invalid product, the website would display nothing and jump back to the main page. Moreover, we added
the shopping cart, which made it possible to buy different products at a time. At last, we implemented the email 
notification, which would inform our customers when thier order has been made successfully. 

4.22-4.23
We asked those two UPS teams to test our servers together. During testing, we have sloved several synchronized and concurrent
problems happened in message sending and receiving. Besides, we have adjusted the layout of our website to make it become more 
user-friendly. We have tried to increased the flakiness of the world simulator to test the performance of our server under
a more unstable environment, and the result was basically correct.

4.24
We added the docker file, danger-log and differentiation text in our repository and met with UPS teams for final testing.
All results are correct as expected.
